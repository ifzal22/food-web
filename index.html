    <h1>About ME</h1>
    <p>Nut allergy is a condition where the body reacts abnormally to the harmless proteins naturally present in nuts.
         The immune system ‘attacks’ the nut proteins, setting off a chain of reactions that release natural chemicals in the body,
         as it mistakes the proteins as a threat to the body.</p>
